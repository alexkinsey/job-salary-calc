            Use our pay calculator to get a breakdown of your hourly, weekly, monthly, and annual pay. It's a great tool
            to help you understand your income and help plan your finances. Simply provide an amount over a pay period
            and the hours you work, for example, Â£2600 a month, at 35 hours a week, and the calculator will output the
            result.
